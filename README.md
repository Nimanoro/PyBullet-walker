# PyBullet-walker

test.py is a simple PyBullet simulation example that generates a plane and an r2d2 model. It can be used to examine the basic behaviour of PyBullet sims or to test whether PyBullet works on your computer.

walker_1.0 is a walker model we found on the web. We simplified and sped it up a bit, it is currently not taking any inputs.
python walker.py        to run the simulation
